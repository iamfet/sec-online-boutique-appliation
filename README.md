## üîí Security

### Security-First Development Approach
This project implements a comprehensive security strategy that integrates security controls throughout the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC).

### Multi-Layer Security Scanning

#### Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- **SonarQube**: Comprehensive code quality and security analysis
- **golangci-lint**: Go-specific static analysis with security rules
- **Coverage**: Identifies code quality issues, security hotspots, and vulnerabilities

#### Secrets Detection
- **Gitleaks**: Scans entire repository history for exposed secrets
- **Scope**: API keys, passwords, tokens, and sensitive configuration
- **Prevention**: Blocks commits containing potential secrets

#### Dependency Security
- **Snyk**: Vulnerability scanning for third-party dependencies
- **Coverage**: Known vulnerabilities in npm, pip, Maven, and Go modules
- **Remediation**: Provides fix recommendations and upgrade paths

#### Container Security
- **Trivy**: Comprehensive container image vulnerability scanning
- **Scope**: OS packages, application dependencies, and misconfigurations
- **Integration**: Scans images before registry push

### Vulnerability Management
- **DefectDojo**: Centralized vulnerability management platform
- **Automated Reporting**: All scan results automatically uploaded
- **Risk Assessment**: Vulnerability prioritization and tracking
- **Compliance**: Security findings mapped to compliance frameworks

### Security Pipeline Integration

                          Compliance Reporting
```

### Security Best Practices
- **Shift-Left Security**: Security testing integrated early in development
- **Parallel Scanning**: Multiple security tools run concurrently
- **Non-Blocking**: Security scans don't halt development workflow
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Ongoing security assessment in production
- **SARIF Standards**: Standardized security findings format
- **Zero-Trust Architecture**: Service-to-service authentication via mTLS

## üöÄ Deployment

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Kubernetes Cluster** | v1.20+ with RBAC enabled |
| **Docker Registry** | Access to Docker Hub or private registry |
| **Required Secrets** | All pipeline secrets configured in GitHub |
| **Resource Requirements** | Minimum 4 CPU cores and 8GB RAM |
| **Network** | LoadBalancer or Ingress controller for external access |

### Quick Start
```bash
# Deploy all services
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/k8s-config.yaml

# Verify deployment
kubectl get pods -l app

# Access the application
kubectl port-forward svc/frontend 8080:80
```

### Individual Service Deployment
```bash
# Deploy specific service
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/[service-name]/deploy.yaml

# Check service status
kubectl get deployment [service-name]
kubectl get service [service-name]
```

### Advanced Deployment Strategies

#### Blue-Green Deployment
```bash
# Deploy blue-green setup for frontend
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/frontend/blue-green-deployment.yaml

# Switch traffic between versions
kubectl patch service frontend -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"green"}}}'
```

#### Canary Deployment
```bash
# Deploy canary version
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/frontend/canary-deployment.yaml

# Monitor canary metrics before full rollout
kubectl get pods -l version=canary
```

### Production Considerations

| Consideration | Implementation |
|---------------|----------------|
| **Resource Limits** | Configure appropriate CPU/memory limits |
| **Health Checks** | Ensure liveness and readiness probes are configured |
| **Persistent Storage** | Configure volumes for stateful services |
| **Network Policies** | Implement pod-to-pod communication restrictions |
| **Monitoring** | Deploy observability stack via GitOps repository |

## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline

The GitHub Actions pipeline implements a comprehensive DevSecOps workflow with parallel security scanning and automated deployment. Each service has its own dedicated pipeline that triggers on pull requests to the main branch.

### Pipeline Stages

1. **Build & Test** - Language-specific compilation and unit testing
2. **Code Quality** - Static analysis with golangci-lint for Go services
3. **Security Scanning** - Parallel execution of multiple security tools:
   - **Gitleaks**: Secret detection across the entire repository
   - **Snyk**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - **SonarQube**: Code quality and security analysis
4. **Container Build & Scan** - Docker image creation with Trivy security scanning
5. **Manifest Update** - Automated Kubernetes deployment manifest updates
6. **GitOps Trigger** - Repository dispatch to trigger GitOps deployment

### Pipeline Features
- **Parallel Execution**: Security scans run concurrently for faster feedback
- **Continue on Error**: Security scans marked as `continue-on-error: true` to prevent blocking
- **SARIF Integration**: Security findings uploaded to GitHub Security tab
- **DefectDojo Integration**: All scan results automatically uploaded to vulnerability management platform
- **Conditional Deployment**: Container build only proceeds if security scans complete

### Required Secrets

#### Container Registry
- **`DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`** - Docker Hub registry username for image publishing
- **`DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`** - Docker Hub access token for authentication

#### Security Scanning
- **`SNYK_TOKEN`** - Snyk API token for dependency vulnerability scanning
- **`SONAR_TOKEN`** - SonarQube authentication token for code analysis
- **`SONAR_URL`** - SonarQube server URL for API calls

#### Vulnerability Management
- **`DEFECTDOJO_URL`** - DefectDojo instance URL for vulnerability management
- **`DEFECTDOJO_TOKEN`** - DefectDojo API token for scan result uploads
- **`DEFECTDOJO_ENGAGEMENT_ID`** - DefectDojo engagement ID for organizing scan results

#### Git Operations
- **`ACTIONS_PA_TOKEN`** - GitHub Personal Access Token for repository operations
- **`USER_EMAIL`** - Git user email for automated commits
- **`USER_NAME`** - Git username for automated commits

### Pipeline Example: Product Catalog Service
Triggered on pull requests affecting `src/productcatalogservice/`:
- **Build**: Compile with Go 1.22 and run unit tests with coverage
- **Security**: Parallel execution of golangci-lint, Gitleaks, Snyk, and SonarQube
- **Container**: Build Docker image and scan with Trivy for vulnerabilities
- **Deploy**: Update Kubernetes manifests with new image tag
- **GitOps**: Trigger deployment via repository dispatch to GitOps repo

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Local Development
```bash
# Navigate to specific service
cd src/[service-name]
# Follow service-specific README for setup and running
```

### Pre-commit Security Scanning

#### Gitleaks Pre-commit Hook
Configure Gitleaks as a pre-commit hook to automatically block commits containing secrets.

#### Setup Pre-commit Hook
Create executable pre-commit hook in `.git/hooks/pre-commit`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Gitleaks pre-commit hook - commits are automatically blocked if secrets found
path_to_host_folder_to_scan=$(pwd)
docker run --rm -v ${path_to_host_folder_to_scan}:/path zricethezav/gitleaks:latest detect --source="/path" --verbose
```

```bash
# Make the hook executable
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

## üîß Configuration

### Security Integration
- **DefectDojo**: Centralized vulnerability management and reporting
- **Automated Uploads**: Security scan results automatically sent to DefectDojo
- **SARIF Reports**: Standardized security findings format for GitHub Security tab
